    If you're not in touch with Dao,

    If you don't have integrity, 
    there's always kindness.
    If you don't have kindness, 
    there's always justice.
    If you don't have justice,
    all you have left is righteousness.
    
    Righteousness is an pale imitation 
    of true faith and loyalty,
    and always leads to trouble.

    you don't know the first thing about Dao, 
    and you never will.

    to what's beneath the surface.
    They'll look at a tree's leaves, 
    but eat the fruit.
    They turn all that down,

    to be in touch with Dao:
    
    Dao made the heavens clear.
    Dao made the earth solid.
    Dao made our spirits strong.
    Dao made the valleys fertile.
    Dao gave all living things life.
    Dao gave rulers authority.

    but they don't practice moderation
    in their own lives.
    They act like leaders, 
    but they have no sense of modesty.
    No good can come of this.
    
    If you want to get ahead, 
    show people compassion.
    When other people attack you,
    defend yourself with compassion.
    It's the most powerful force in the universe.

    A true warrior never uses force

    There's an old military saying:
    "I'd rather face an attack 
    than have to make one.
    I'd rather retreat a foot 
    than try to advance an inch."
    
    That's the secret to moving forward 
    while staying put,
    preparing for battle 
    without revealing your strength.
    
    When you defend yourself 
    without any show of force,
    you give your opponent 
    nothing to fight.
    
    Attacking an enemy 
    you've underestimated 
    is a costly mistake.
    When two forces oppose each other,
    the winner is the one most reluctant to fight.

    Lao Tzu's advice 
    was easy to understand 
    and easy to follow.
    But nobody understood him 
    or did what he suggested.
    
    His words 
    stemmed from ancient wisdom,
    and his actions were highly disciplined.
    People didn't get that,
    which is why 
    they didn't understand him.
    And the less they understood him,
    the more meaningful his advice became.
    
    That's why the Masters live simply,
    hiding their wisdom deep within themselves.

    Lao Tzu said using Dao 
    was like pulling on a bowstring:
    The top bends down, 
    the bottom bends up,
    and all the energy 
    is focused in the middle.
    
    Dao takes energy from where it is,
    and sends it where it needs to be.
    But most people take from those 
    who don't have enough,
    so those who have too much already 
    can have more.
    
    So who in this world 
    is truly generous to others?
    People who are in touch with Dao.

    They get the job done and move on.
